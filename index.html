            About Me
          </h2>
          <p>I have been developing since I was in my first year of highschool, and I've been in love with computers longer than I can remember. 
            I love the challenge that programming provides, and I'm always ready to pursue grander goals. 
            Now I'm doing my best to learn as much as I possibly can, that way I can continue to drive my ambitions forward.</p>

            Experience
          </h2>
          <p>I have been on a highschool robotics team as a member and a mentor. While I was a member of the team, I was the Programming lead.
            With this role I would lead a team of students to communicate with a hardware team to program a robot to complete set challenges.
            I later become a mentor as I graduated, where I took a more supervisory role to ensure the team is on task and accomplishing goals.
